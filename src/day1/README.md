I saw a lot of comments about this challenge.  
A few videos I watched that got the answer correct but I could not get a correct answer even following their code.
I admit I used a technique I found on another solution that, at first, seems a bit hacky but it works. I guess it is not 
too terrible to leverage assumed knowledge to achieve an outcome.
